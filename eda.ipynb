provided code is well-executed in several aspects. The Virginia demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and data type conversions, ensuring a clean dataset for analysis.

Virginia also used the method of replacing missing values with the mode with two featues, which is a strategy that we agreed upon. Furthermore, Virginia used a random forest along with a regressor, which the model mistakenly predicted continuous numerical values for default. However, default is a binary classification. Thus, one suggestion that we discussed at our meeting was changing the regressor to a different ML method to ensure that it predicts either 1 or 0 for default. Overall, the data cleansing and transformation was job really well."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Kefan's comments: Virgina's way of dropping nan values in \"jobs\" and \"marital\" columns and replacing with mode in \"housing\" and \"loan\" columns is the same as my approach, and I have the same opinion as Connor that regressor is not suitable in this case but it only works for continuous variables, and it will return decimals with categorical encoding."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"celltoolbar":"Raw Cell Format","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.10","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.9"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
